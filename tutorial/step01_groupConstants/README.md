## Group Constants

Here, group constants are taken from example Serpent output using PyNE. These will be used to generate a properties directory, which
can be used by moltres. See extractSerpent2GCs.py for more.

Moltres is *not* a spatially homogenized diffusion code. MOOSE is made for running, **big**, **intense** problems, using modern HPC.
Because there is no desire to homogenize spatially here, the materials that the user would like used in moltres should each fill their
own infinite universe. Then, this universe should have its group constants generated using the "set gcu <material universe numbers>".

It's important that universe 0, the main universe, is not included. Serpent takes tallies for group constants in the first universe
it identifies, so including 0 means that no further universes will be included in GC generation. (please double check this on the serpent
forum).

### Serpent Input

Here, serpent input can be found to simulate ORNL's molten salt reactor experiment, documented largely on websites like
(this)[http://www.energyfromthorium.com/pdf/] one.

For group constant generation, Cole Gentry found that a 4 group structure with three thermal groups and one fast group works
well in the graphite moderated FHR. There is also an available recommended 13 group structure, which could be found by changing
some comment characters around in the include file defining group structures. The PDF of these findings can be found (here)[http://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/3695/].

The "fuel" file contains "cards" (a relic term referring to the fortran-dominated reactor physics ages of yore)
that will generate group constants at a few temperatures, and likewise for the "moder" file.
Like a cooking show, the important results have already been prepared for you in the "fuel.coe" and "moder.coe" files, which
get parsed by ```serpentTools``` in the extractSerpent2GCs script. ```serpentTools``` is a suite of parsers designed by GATech for parsing ```SERPENT``` output files. More information can be found at http://serpent-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

### Command to run:

The command to run in order to generate the moltres-compatible group constants is:

```$MOLTRES/python/extractSerpent2GCs.py MSREProperties msre_gentry_4g tempMapping.txt secBranch.txt universeMapping.txt```

Where $MOLTRES is an environment variable leading to the install location of Moltres. An alternative would be to just add
the $MOLTRES/python directory to your path.

The syntax requires the arbitrary directory name you'd like to create, then the arbitrary file base name that moltres will
look at, then a file that maps primary branch names to temperatures, then a file that lists the secondary branch names, and lastly a file that maps universe numbers from serpent to material names. 
Group constants will be extracted for all materials listed in the last file.

The secBranch.txt file should be blank if no secondary branches were used, i.e. there is only one branch variation per burnup step.
