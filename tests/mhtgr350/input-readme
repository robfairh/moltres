*auto.i: 
  -runs neutronics for unit-cell.msh
  -it's not complete, uses wrong-density cross sections
  -thermo-hydraulics data not complete either

*auto1.i:
  -should run neutronics for unit-cell-reflec.msh
  -it doesn't work: seg fault
  -it's not complete, uses wrong-density cross sections
  -thermo-hydraulics data not complete either

*auto2.i:
  -run thermohydraulics for unit-cell-reflec2.msh
  -thermo-hydraulics data not complete either
  -just for the purpose of seing that the mesh works properly on moltres

*autob.i:
  -intends to use the nt action
  -it runs. it seems to take longer. it diverges. why?
  -it's not complete, uses wrong-density cross sections
  -thermo-hydraulics data not complete either

*autoc.i:
  -intends to not use any action, precursors defined as kernels
  -does it run?
  -it's not complete, uses wrong-density cross sections
