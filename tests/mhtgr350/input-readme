*auto.i: 
  -unit-cell.msh: unit cell w/o reflectors
  -neutronics kernels
  -k=1 (scaling=?)
  -thermo-hydraulics data not complete

  -unit-cell.msh: unit cell w/o reflectors
  -neutronics kernels (account_delayed=false)
  -k=1, but negative flux (groups no scaling, temperature scaling=1e-4)
  -thermo-hydraulics data not complete

  -unit-cell.msh: unit cell w/o reflectors
  -neutronics kernels (account_delayed=false)
  -k=1, positive flux (groups scaling=1e-4, temperature scaling=1e-4)
  -thermo-hydraulics data not complete

*autob.i:
  -unit-cell.msh: unit cell w/o reflectors
  -nt action
  -k=1.43, it diverges
  -thermo-hydraulics data not complete either

  -unit-cell.msh: unit cell w/o reflectors
  -nt action (account_delayed=false)
  -k=1.27, it diverges
  -thermo-hydraulics data not complete either

*auto1.i:
  -unit-cell-reflec.msh: unit cell w/ reflectors
  -neutronics kernels
  -it doesn't work: seg fault
  -thermo-hydraulics data not complete either






*auto2.i:
  -run thermohydraulics for unit-cell-reflecb.msh
  -thermo-hydraulics data not complete either
  -just for the purpose of seing that the mesh works properly on moltres

*auto1b.i:
  -intends to use the nt action
  -it doesn't work: seg fault
  -it's not complete, uses wrong-density cross sections
  -thermo-hydraulics data not complete either

*auto3.i:
  -reduced mesh. just a fuel channel.
  -it runs and reaches stable steady state
  -uses the nt action
  -it's not complete, uses wrong-density cross sections (??) I think the xs are fine here
  -thermo-hydraulics data not complete either

*auto3b.i:
  -reduced mesh. just a fuel channel with top and bottom reflectors.
  -intends to use the nt action
  -it runs and reaches stable steady state
  -it's not complete, uses wrong-density cross sections (??) I think the xs are fine here
  -thermo-hydraulics data not complete either

*auto4b.i:
  -reduced mesh. fuel channel + moderator + top and bottom reflectors.
  -uses nt action
  -seg fault
  -it's not complete, uses wrong-density cross sections (??) I think the xs are fine here
  -thermo-hydraulics data not complete either
