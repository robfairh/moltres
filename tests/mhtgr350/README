Python scripts:
---------------

* full_core.py: Produces full geometry.
* extend_arc2D.py: Produces 2D geometry of 1/12th (30 degress) of the reactor.
Then the geometry has to be extruded and add the physical groups by hand to produce the 3D geometry.
* fuel_assembly.py: Produces geometry of one fuel assembly.
